- Make a pull request to this repository with **ONLY** one new blog post.
- For those who wish to contribute without using github, copy the template to a new file, write your post, use the correct naming conventions for jekyll (as evidenced by the template) and then upload your post to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/llvsrI6z5tqWCSyl9OcY).

The raw template is located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/table-tome/blog-posts/7a179208b561fbde0e5f5d5c54e5cc9cd570fe31/YEAR-MM-DD-post-title.md).

After you use one of the above steps to write a post and submit it, your post will be reviewed!
